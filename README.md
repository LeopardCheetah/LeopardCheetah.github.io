# LeopardCheetah.github.io
my website (under construction)

so it turns out de-scoping really helps with finishing projects.


All `.html` files in the home directory are part of the website, and the corresponding files used to generate them are in the `raw/` folder. The `.md` -> `.html` generator itself is located at `generators/generator.py` and some `.html` templates (just kidding there's only 1) are located at `generators/templates/`. 

Website information is displayed on the website at `info.html` (`raw/info.md`), and the todo list for things to do is also up there (`todo.html`, `raw/todo.md`).
