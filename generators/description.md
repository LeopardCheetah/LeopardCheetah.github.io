this folder (**generators**) contains all the necessary elements needed to generate webpages for my websites.    
namely it has the script that turns `.md` files into `.html` ones and all the `.html` templates that I need.

## Disclaimer

Disclaimer: `generator.py` will not perfectly convert ALL `.md` files -- there are most definitely edge cases that I've missed and/or weird behaviors that I code wrong.     
In the case of one of those edge cases, you *can* open a PR (I may not get around to it), but it's most likely quicker if you either (a) tweak the specific markdown code to make it more 'tame', (b) fix the corresponding `.html` file manually to what you want it to be, or (c) rewrite `generator.py` to your liking.
