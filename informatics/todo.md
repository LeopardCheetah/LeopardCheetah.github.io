todo list:

done:    
- [x] make my website (semi-functionally)    
- [x] make a custom 404 page    

in progress/considering/whatever:   
- [ ] make the generator ACTUALLY turn `.md` into `.html` (as opposed to just adding the lines raw)
- [ ] implement custom tags! -- e.g. custom box tihngies that can be made during .md -> .html    
- [ ] make my basic webpage be in the style of playing cards (consult drawings)    
- [ ] make my 404 page look cooler 
- [ ] make a custom 500 page (+ when would i need this)        
- [ ] fix my broken shark favicon (does it need to be of type ico?)    
- [ ] implement subpages (currently this is IMPOSSIBLE lmao)   
- [ ] add a silly little website :)

- [ ] add footnote support
- [ ] turn this into a legit open src thing with good readmes + docs (or maybe rewrite this)
- [ ] add emoji support (and then update `description.md`)

 
not doing:   
- [ ] make `generator.py` conform to the markdown spec. is just too time consuming + annoying for me to cover the edge cases, and I'll assume that most md is written nicely -- aka written the way i write it. (spec: https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/)
