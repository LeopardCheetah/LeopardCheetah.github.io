>>> put in gwern's unseeing quote on how things are just brute facts at the end of the day.

> tribute to calvin and hobbes page?

- integrate everything into the index.md page.

========================================================
ideas:

- make my website look better. Move the margins out, do less, make things simpler. 
=> add my own "twist" / "flair" to my website.

- make generator.py correspondingly delete pages if the corresponding .md file doesn't exist 
=> or just make it delete all .html files and regenerate them from scratch each time.

- (maybe) rewrite generator.py? actually parse those hard things that were unparsable.
