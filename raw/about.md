Hi! I'm Alex. 

Here's a short list of things that I enjoy doing:
- Reading Calvin and Hobbes (only when I get the joke)
- Programming (only when everything makes sense)
- Doing math (only when the problems seem to be somewhat attainable and doable)
- Admiring Nature (only when I'm not sick with some respiratory illness I get every December)
- Playing ping pong


More information about me is soon to come :)
