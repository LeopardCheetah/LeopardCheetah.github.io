# todo list

a few features i (may) want to implement in my website:

---

considering:
- [ ] a projects tab with projects that i've done in it    
- [ ] **be able to generate projects from md files** -- would make things a lot simpler    
- [ ] interacive projects (js port? python??) on that project tab   
- [ ] dark mode toggle

---

maybe:
- [ ] make all the buttons prettier and stuff like that (see <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon.png"/>)   
- [ ] uh maybe move my blog over here   
- [ ] make dark mode auto select


---

done:
- [x] robots.txt
