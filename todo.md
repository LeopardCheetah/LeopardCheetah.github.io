a few features i want to implement in my website:

- [ ] a projects tab with projects that i've done in it    
- [ ] **be able to generate projects from md files** -- would make things a lot simpler    
- [ ] interacive projects (js port? python??) on that project tab   
- [ ] uh maybe move my blog over here    
- [x] robots.txt   
- [ ] make all the buttons prettier and stuff like that
